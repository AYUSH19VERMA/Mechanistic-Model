## Getting Started
● Creating a biochemical reaction network
● Set of ODEs
● Assign values to each object in the model
● Use simulator to solve equations
# Pipeline-_Project
# ODE_Simulations_final.py
ODE file .py file
The file contains code to simulate ODEs mentioned in in silico fungal persistence paper.
# Copy_of_ODE_Simulations_final.ipynb
ODE simulations file of .ipynb
The notebook contains the code and plots of the in silico fungal persistence paper.
# validate.py
File to check/validate if .yml file is correctly formatted.
# convert_yaml_sbml.py
File to convert yaml(.yml) to sbml(.xml).
# SBML_file.xml
This is the generated sbml file(.xml extension) from the yaml(.yml) file using yaml2sbml.
# Ayush files
All the files required for simulating and validating model.
# Mechanistic_Model_PyPesto
Parameter optimisation of mechanistic model using pypesto
# lotka_pypesto
Parameter optimisation of Lotka model using pypesto
# Mechanistic_Model_plots and results.ipynb
Simulated mechanistic model equations and contains plot of model.
# SBML_file.xml
Fungal Infection model into SBML
# amici.ipynb
Some implementation of amici to the model
